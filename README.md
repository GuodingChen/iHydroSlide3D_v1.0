### **Important: This Version Is No Longer Supported**

We've migrated the model to a new version, which is now actively updated and maintained. For the latest features and improvements, please check out the [new version here](https://github.com/GuodingChen/PHyL_v1.0). Thank you for your support!

### iHydroSlide3D v1.0
### ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v1.0-blue)		![APM](https://img.shields.io/apm/l/vim-mode)		![](https://img.shields.io/badge/computing%20core-%3E%3D2-green) 

iHydroSlide3D v1.0 was created by State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering at Hohai University. The goal of iHydroSlide3D v1.0 is to provide a relatively comprehensive and reliable diagnosis for a flood-landslide event, including (i) complete hydrological components (e.g., soil moisture and streamflow), (ii) a landslide susceptibility assessment (factor of safety and probability of occurrence), and (iii) a landslide hazard analysis (geometric properties of potential failures). The model mainly includes the following submodules: (i) physical-based hydrological model; (ii) 3D landslide model; and (iii) soil moisture downscaling method. The model can currently process two sets of data with different resolutions, allowing to simultaneously carry out simulations of hydrological and geotechnical in different precisions. iHydroSlide3D is written in Matlab and capable of running in a parallel manner, currently supporting Linux and Windows operating systems.
